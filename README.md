HIDV3D is a web-based 3D data visualiser that lets you upload a CSV file and explore your data in an 3D space, using both your mouse and your hands in front of a webcam. 

## What it does

- Upload a CSV and turn rows into 3D points, bars, or surfaces in the browser. 
- Orbit, pan, and zoom the scene with standard mouse or touch controls. 
- Enable hand tracking to rotate, pan, and zoom the camera. 

## Tech stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, PapaParse, Handtrack.js. 
- Backend: Node.js. 
- Database: PostgreSQL for user data, CSV metadata, and saved views.
